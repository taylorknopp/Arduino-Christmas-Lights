This is still a work in progress.  The code and controll board cirtuit are designed for a [SeeKool ESP32 ESP32S Development Board](https://www.amazon.ca/SeeKool-Development-Microcontroller-Integrated-Compatible/dp/B07NPHFBM4/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?cv_ct_cx=esp32&dchild=1&keywords=esp32&pd_rd_i=B07NPHFBM4&pd_rd_r=d8b281b0-760d-4f36-9016-394d0bca15d8&pd_rd_w=BeXtq&pd_rd_wg=18FBv&pf_rd_p=2998f0ae-168e-4223-948d-9c73eb26503d&pf_rd_r=5FACCJAMFK001F03X1Q6&psc=1&qid=1600362219&sr=1-1-791c2399-d602-4248-afbb-8a79de2d236f). The ciruits were created using EasyEDA and all gerber files can be found in the Circuits folder, or the project can be found on EasyEDA [here](https://easyeda.com/taylorknopp/esp32christmaslights)
